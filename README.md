# Twitter Analytics Dashboard - Power BI
<!-- ### Live Project Demo  <a href="https://jobportal-analysis.netlify.app/"><strong>‚û• JobPortal-Analytics</strong></a> -->

The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive Twitter Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, leveraging data from Data World to provide valuable insights into Twitter activity and engagement. The data is sourced from Data World and includes various columns such as Tweet, id, time, impressions, engagements, engagement rate, retweets, replies, likes, user profile clicks, URL clicks, hashtag clicks, detail expands, permalink clicks, app opens, app installs, follows, email tweet, dial phone, media views, and media engagements.

## ‚úÖProject Overview
Insights gained from the dashboard include a comprehensive count of all retweets, average impressions and engagement rate to understand overall performance, the maximum likes to highlight the most liked tweet, tweet count by week to observe tweeting frequency over time, URL clicks by tweet to assess the effectiveness of shared links, a comparison of media engagements vs. media views to evaluate interaction with media content, and impressions by week to monitor the reach of tweets on a weekly basis. 

## üìùSteps Involved:
1.  Define the Problem / Question
2. Collect Data / EDA
3. Clean and Prepare Data / ETL 
4. Analyze the Data / Data Transformation
5. Interpret Results / Building Dashboard
6. Share Findings / Documentation

## üéØLearning Objectives 
### Tools & Technologies Used:

- Power BI: Used for data transformation, modelling, and visualization.
- Microsoft Excel: The dataset was saved into the excel file after downloading it from Data World Website.
- Power Query Editor: Utilized for ETL Process like data cleaning, transforming columns, and extracting time-related attributes.
- Visualizations: Various types like gauge, card, slicer, stacked column chart, stacked bar chart, pie chart, and line chart for data visualization.
- Dashboard Customization: Formatting options, shapes, and text boxes used to customize the dashboard appearance.

## ‚≠êFeatures and Benefits
Various visualizations are used in the dashboard, including a gauge to display metrics such as engagement rate or total impressions, cards to highlight key metrics like total tweets, total retweets, and maximum likes, slicers to filter data based on specific criteria such as date ranges or tweet types, stacked column charts to compare metrics such as engagements and impressions across different periods, stacked bar charts to visualize distributions such as likes and retweets by tweet, pie charts to show proportions of different types of engagements, and line charts to illustrate trends over time, such as impressions or engagements per week.
